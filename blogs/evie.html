		<ul>
		<li>my name is evie, and i use it/she pronouns</li>
		<li>if you came here from sayofthelor.us, that domain will be redirecting to this article for a bit before being a simple link to the homepage.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>probably a lot to randomly reveal that i have a new name and (gasp) am a neopronoun user but this has been a pretty big weight on me for a <strong>really</strong> long time so i think it's about time everyone got to know the real me a little better!</p>
		<p>in terms of what to expect from me here, i've been involved in a few escapades and i have a log of some places i've been that i'm planning to write about right here, so look forward to that (whenever i get around to writing them lol)</p>
		<p>anyways if you deadname me i will Find You goodbye meow ^ ^</p>
