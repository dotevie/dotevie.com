## basically:
- my name is evie, and i use it/she pronouns
- if you came here from sayofthelor.us, that domain will be redirecting to this article for a bit before being a simple link to the homepage.

probably a lot to randomly reveal that i have a new name and (gasp) am a neopronoun user but this has been a pretty big weight on me for a **really** long time so i think it's about time everyone got to know the real me a little better!

in terms of what to expect from me here, i've been involved in a few escapades and i have a log of some places i've been that i'm planning to write about right here, so look forward to that (whenever i get around to writing them lol)

anyways if you deadname me i will Find You goodbye meow ^ ^
